1. (1) Create a function with 3 arguments that takes the radius of a circle and calculates the circumference and area of the circle using reference parameters.

2. (1) Create a function (or template) that takes a one-dimensional array as an argument and returns the maximum and minimum values of the array using reference parameters.

3. (1) Write functions for working with a dynamic integer one-dimensional array:

Function to create a dynamic array of a specified size and initialize its elements to zero.
Function to fill the array with random numbers within a user-specified range.
Function to print the array.
Function to append an element to the array.
Function to delete an element at a given position (index).
Function to insert a new element at a specified index.
4. (1) Use the previously developed function library (Task 6) to perform the following operations on a dynamic array of size 20, filled with random numbers in the range [-12..56]:

Insert the absolute value of each negative element after the element itself.
Remove all even elements from the array.
5. (4) Given two dynamic arrays A[n] and B[m], create a third array of the minimum possible size that contains:

Elements from both arrays.
Common elements of both arrays.
Elements from array A that do not appear in array B.
Elements from array B that do not appear in array A.
Elements from arrays A and B that are not common (i.e., the union of the previous two results).
6. (4) Create a function that allows adding a block of elements to the end of an array.
